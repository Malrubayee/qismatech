            <p >Knowledge is a gift that is passed down verbally, physically and biologicaly. 
                    My grandmother's name was Qisma, she was born in the late 1930s in Iraq. 
                    She learnt what she could to survive and to raise a family. 
                    She never knew how to read or write. She gave birth to my Mother in 1960. 
                    My mother, unlike hers, went to school and university and learnt more than just reading and writing; 
                    she became a biologist and was fascinated with science. I was born in 1997. 
                    My mother taught me what she knew of science, surving and rasising a family.
                     On top of all that I learnt about programming and electronics at university. Now, I want to keep
                    the tradition going; passing down what I know to the younger generation.</p>
                <p>At Qisma Tech, we aim to encourage young kiwis, to learn and understand software and electronics
                    engineering at a level that they can understand, so that they can contribute to the future of tech in NZ.
                </p>
                <p>We believe in your child's intelligence and their capabilty to grow and in progressing New Zealand further.
                    By learning from the past, respecting our roots and looking enthusiasticaly to the future, 
                    we will make our childrens' lives more effecient, safer, cleaner and richer.
