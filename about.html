            <p >Knowledge is a gift that is passed down verbally, physically and biologicaly. 
                    My grandmother's name was Qisma, she was born in the late 1930s in Iraq. 
                    She learnt what she could to live and raise a family. She never knew how to read or write. 
                    She gave birth to my Mother in the 60s. 
                    My mother, went to school and university and learnt more than just reading and writing; 
                    she became a biologist and was fascinated with science. I was born in 1997. 
                    I have my mother's and Grandmother's knowledge of life, science and religion and I have
                    new knowledge of tech that my mother and grandmother both did not have. 
                    Now, I want to keep the tradition going; passing down what I know to the younger generation.</p>
                <p>At Qisma Tech, we aim to help young kiwis to develop their skills in computational thinking through
                    the means of physical games. We believe that children learn best when they think that they're not learning.
                    These games will get your child off the screen and outside while at the same time, having developed their
                    understanding of electronics and computational concepts such as conservation of energy, if-statements and more!
                </p>
                <p>We believe in your child's intelligence and their capabilty to grow and be part of progressing New Zealand further.
                    By learning from the past, respecting our roots and looking enthusiasticaly to the future, 
                    we will make our childrens' lives more effecient, safer, cleaner and richer.
                </p>
